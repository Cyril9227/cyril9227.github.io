# Disclaimer (this is financial advice)

Please take as many loans as you can, take your girlfriend's jewelry and gaslight her into thinking she's lost it, the following trade is 100% guaranteed and is financial advice. Don't be a pussy and DO IT.

# Background

Both blockchains are competing for the same niche of ultra-fast, high TPS blockchains. There can be only one king of the jungle. 

# SUI is an overvalued piece of garbage

It's unclear what it does nor who is actually using this. Going through their twitter, I can't find any meaningful project or partner, same after some basic googling. <br>

I found a social-fi (whatever that is) app with no users https://suia.io/, a NFT marketplace (for SUI), a DEX (for SUI) etc. They mention gaming, finance in their website yet no one is actually using it for these purpose in real-life. On a surface level, it just feels that they built a blockchain for the sake of building a blockchain. <br>

Yet the market cap is a whooping 5.5B USD. The fuck ? <br>

Ah, and "infrastructure partners" are dumping on retail (you lol)

# FTM is undervalued

I'll keep it short and sweet : 
<ul>
  <li>Built by Cronje (one of the DeFi OG) and his team, total faith in their ability to deliver (once again) solid tech </li>
  <li>Ultra-fast, ultra-cheap, and fees structure to pay builders</li>
  <li>Previous ATH of 3$ now only trading at ~70 cents</li>
  <li>1:1 swap between current FTM token and yet-to-be Sonic token, you're buying the presales basically</li>
  <li>Slept on by everyone yet slowly gaining mainshare, some of the main characters (/grifters) of this cycle are getting onboard (Ansem etc)</li>
  <li>Had one of the highest TVL last cycle and the best DeFi ponzis</li>
  <li>Built-in Ethereum gateway or whatever, killing most L2s</li>
  <li>Market cap only at 2B (2.5x below SUI !!!), slowly grinding up</li>
  <li>Tons of projects and new DeFi primitives coming up (Pendle finance etc.)</li>
  <li>No predatory VC nor insiders to dump on your ass, Fantom foundation has enough dough to sustain itself for a long time</li>
</ul>

# Trade as of today (20th October 2024)

Pair trade in a paper account that I plan to keep open until the end of the bull-run (or until FTM is rolled out for SONIC), we'll see in real-time how the thesis plays out. I'll post update if I'm right (to brag) or delete this post if I'm wrong (sorry not sorry).
