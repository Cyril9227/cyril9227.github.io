I've seen this tweet recently comparing returns of some hedge fund and a passive index fund, besides missing the point of what hedge funds are for (hedging downside risk while *trying* to keep up with or beat the market), I feel it's a good excuse to learn some basic risk management and indicators, arguably more important than your PnL.

## Data stuff

Just pull some trading data from your favorite exchange, the formating should be relatively similar. I'm only using 1 month worth of trading for simplicity.

```python
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Load the data
trade_history = pd.read_csv("trade_history.csv")
# Make sure the time column is a datetime object
trade_history['time'] = pd.to_datetime(trade_history['time'], format='%m/%d/%Y - %H:%M:%S')
# Only keep the last month of trading
trade_history = trade_history[(trade_history['time'] >= (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)))]
```

`trade_history.head()` should look something like this:

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/img/trading/dataset.png" alt="data">
</figure>

With `time` being the timestamp of the trade, `coin` the symbol you're trading, `dir` the direction of the trade (buy or sell), `px` the price, `sz` the size of the trade (number of coins), `ntl` the notional value of the trade (size * price), `fee` the fee paid for the trade which is accounted for in the `closedPnl`, your profit or loss for the given trade.

## Max Drawdown

The maximum drawdown is the maximum loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, which is a decent measure of volatility and risk. If you have an insane drawdown, that means that you're probably taking too much risk and are willing to accept a lot of volatility ðŸ‘½

```python
# Keep track of the cumulative pnl and the maximum value it has reached at any point of time
trade_history['cumulative_pnl'] = trade_history['closedPnl'].cumsum()
trade_history['rolling_max'] = trade_history['cumulative_pnl'].cummax()

# Drawdown for each trade is how far the cumulative pnl is from the rolling max (peak)
trade_history['drawdown'] = trade_history['rolling_max'] - trade_history['cumulative_pnl']

# The maximum drawdown is simply the max over each trade's drawdown (peak to valley)
max_drawdown = trade_history['drawdown'].max()
print(f"Max drawdown : {max_drawdown:.1f} USD")
# >>> Max drawdown : 41.1 USD
```
In this toy example, the max drawdown is 41.1 USD, which means that at some point in the last month, the portfolio was down 40 bucks from its peak value.

## Sharpe Ratio

*The Sharpe ratio is a measure of risk-adjusted return, which is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. It's a good measure to compare different strategies or portfolios, the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the risk-adjusted return.*<br> ^What this chatgpt verbiage is saying is that the sharpe ratio compares your return to something risk-free, divided by the volatility. To maximize the sharpe ratio, you want to maximize your return against the default risk-free and minimize your volatility (Nb : usually, it makes more sense to use this ratio to compare 2 strats rather than a standalone number). <br>

We can start by computing few useful stats : 

```python
# Group by timestamp and sum to get total PNL / size per timestamp (day)
daily_pnl = trade_history.groupby(trade_history['time'].dt.date)['closedPnl'].sum()  # PNL in USD
daily_size = trade_history.groupby(trade_history['time'].dt.date)['ntl'].sum()  # Size in USD

# Daily returns as a percentage of the size trade
daily_returns = daily_pnl / daily_size

# Min - max - average - standard deviation of daily returns
avg_daily_return = daily_returns.mean()
min_daily_return = daily_returns.min()
max_daily_return = daily_returns.max()
daily_std = daily_returns.std()

print(f"Average daily returns : {avg_daily_return:.2%} (std : {daily_std:.2%} -- min : {min_daily_return:.2%} -- max : {max_daily_return:.2%})")
# >>> Average daily returns : 3.40% (std : 7.04% -- min : -0.01% -- max : 23.66%)
```

Here we can see that we only got wins (min being just a trade fee) (yayy), with an average daily return of 3.4% and a standard deviation of 7.04%, which is a bit high but not too bad.<br>

Now we need to find the risk-free rate, which is usually the return on a US treasury bond, but for simplicity I'll use $5\%$ annual as a default value (high yield savings account). Since we're working with daily returns, we need to convert this to a daily rate, which is given by the formula :<br>
$$ r_{\text{daily}} = (1 + r_{\text{annual}})^{1/365} - 1$$

```python
# Assuming 5% annual risk free rate
annual_rf_rate = 0.05
daily_rf_rate = (1 + annual_rf_rate) ** (1/365) - 1
```

The Sharpe ratio is then given by the expected return of the portfolio minus the risk-free rate returns divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio :

$$ \text{Sharpe ratio} = \frac{\mathbb{E}(R_p - R_f)}{\sigma_p}$$ 

```python
# How far we stray from the risk-free rate for each trade (daily in our case)
daily_excess_returns = daily_returns - daily_rf_rate
# Expectation(R - Rf)
mean_daily_excess_return = daily_excess_returns.mean()

# Sharpe ratio (daily)
daily_sharpe = mean_daily_excess_return / daily_std

# Sharpe ratio (annualized)
annual_sharpe = daily_sharpe * (365 ** 0.5)
print(f"Daily sharpe : {daily_sharpe:.2f} -- Annual : {annualised_sharpe:.2f}")
# >>> Daily sharpe : 0.48 -- Annual : 9.18
```
Nb : To *annualize* the sharpe ratio, you need to multiply the daily sharpe ratio by the square root of the number of trading days in a year (365 in crypto, 252 in tradfi).<br>

Here the annualized Sharpe ratio is 9.18, quite optimistic because of the low sample (few trades over 1 month) but this would mean that for each unit of risk we took, we got 9.18 "units" of return, which would be excellent (if we could sustain it, spoilers : it's hard).
